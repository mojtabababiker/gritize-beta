# Gritize

Your open-source ally in the journey to sharpen your problem-solving edge, master coding patterns, and contribute to something bigger than tutorials and coding playgrounds.
Gritize is an open-source platform designed to help developers go beyond just solving algorithmic problems — it provides opportunities to practice real-world, impact-driven project that enhance both technical and problem-solving skills.
